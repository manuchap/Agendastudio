Agendastudio

A little app for rehearsal studio bookings with a news caroussel,bands info+soundcloud and a contact form.
Demo:http://agendastudio.studiowan.fr (wait for it on launch, it's on a free cedar stack at heroku).

Sorry it's in french. I can translate it or make it muti-lang if you'll ask me. I just didn't bother ;-)

Runs on LocomotiveCms(heroku branch) or locally on Wagon(2.2.0)
